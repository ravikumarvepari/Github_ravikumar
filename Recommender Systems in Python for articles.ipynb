    "This notebook is a practical introduction to the main Recommender System (RecSys) techniques. The objective of a RecSys is to recommend relevant items for users, based on their preference. Preference and relevance are subjective, and they are generally inferred by items users have consumed previously.\n",
    "The main RecSys techniques are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering: This method makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating). The underlying assumption of the collaborative filtering approach is that if a person A has the same opinion as a person B on a set of items, A is more likely to have B's opinion for a given item than that of a randomly chosen person.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-Based Filtering: This method uses only information about the description and attributes of the items users has previously consumed to model user's preferences. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid methods: Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining collaborative filtering and content-based filtering could be more effective than pure approaches in some cases. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem"

    "Evaluation is important for machine learning projects, because it allows to compare objectivelly different algorithms and hyperparameter choices for models.\n",
    "One key aspect of evaluation is to ensure that the trained model generalizes for data it was not trained on, using Cross-validation techniques. We are using here a simple cross-validation approach named holdout, in which a random data sample (20% in this case) are kept aside in the training process, and exclusively used for evaluation. All evaluation metrics reported here are computed using the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ps. A more robust evaluation approach could be to split train and test sets by a reference date, where the train set is composed by all interactions before that date, and the test set are interactions after that date. For the sake of simplicity, we chose the first random approach for this notebook, but you may want to try the second approach to better simulate how the recsys would perform in production predicting \"future\" users interactions."

For textual items, like articles, news and books, it is simple to use the raw text to build item profiles and user profiles.\n",

    "Collaborative Filtering (CF) has two main implementation strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory-based: This approach uses the memory of previous users interactions to compute users similarities based on items they've interacted (user-based approach) or compute items similarities based on the users that have interacted with them (item-based approach).\n",
    "A typical example of this approach is User Neighbourhood-based CF, in which the top-N similar users (usually computed using Pearson correlation) for a user are selected and used to recommend items those similar users liked, but the current user have not interacted yet. This approach is very simple to implement, but usually do not scale well for many users. A nice Python implementation of this approach in available in Crab.\n",
    "Model-based: This approach, models are developed using different machine learning algorithms to recommend items to users. There are many model-based CF algorithms, like neural networks, bayesian networks, clustering models, and latent factor models such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and, probabilistic latent semantic analysis."

    "## Matrix Factorization\n",
    "Latent factor models compress user-item matrix into a low-dimensional representation in terms of latent factors. One advantage of using this approach is that instead of having a high dimensional matrix containing abundant number of missing values we will be dealing with a much smaller matrix in lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "A reduced presentation could be utilized for either user-based or item-based neighborhood algorithms that are presented in the previous section. There are several advantages with this paradigm. It handles the sparsity of the original matrix better than memory based ones. Also comparing similarity on the resulting matrix is much more scalable especially in dealing with large sparse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we a use popular latent factor model named Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). There are other matrix factorization frameworks more specific to CF you might try, like surprise, mrec or python-recsys. We chose a SciPy implemenation of SVD because it is available on Kaggle kernels.\n",
    "Ps. See an example of SVD on a movies dataset in this blog post.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important decision is the number of factors to factor the user-item matrix. The higher the number of factors, the more precise is the factorization in the original matrix reconstructions. Therefore, if the model is allowed to memorize too much details of the original matrix, it may not generalize well for data it was not trained on. Reducing the number of factors increases the model generalization."

    "In this notebook, we've explored and compared the main Recommender Systems techniques on CI&T Deskdrop dataset. It could be observed that for articles recommendation, content-based filtering and a hybrid method performed better than Collaborative Filtering alone.\n",

    "There is large room for improvements of the results. Here are some tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we've completely ignored the time, considering that all articles were available to be recommended to users at any time. A better approach would be to filter only articles that were available for users at a given time.\n",
    "You could leverage the available contextual information to model users preferences across time (period of day, day of week, month), location (country and state/district) and devices (browser, mobile native app).\n",
    "This contextual information can be easily incorporated in Learn-to-Rank models (like XGBoost Gradient Boosting Decision Trees with ranking objective) or Logistic models (with categorical features One-Hot encoded or Feature Hashed). Take a look in the summary my solution shared for Outbrain Click Prediction competition.\n",
    "Those basic techniques were used for didactic purposes. There are more advanced techniques in RecSys research community, specially advanced Matrix Factorization and Deep Learning models.\n",
    "You can know more about state-of-the-art methods published in Recommender Systems on ACM RecSys conference.\n",
    "If you are more like practioner than researcher, you might try some Collaborative Filtering frameworks in this dataset, like surprise, mrec, python-recsys and Spark ALS Matrix Factorization (distributed implementation for large datasets).\n",
    "Take a look in this presentation where I describe a production recommender system, focused on Content-Based Filtering and Topic Modeling techniques."
